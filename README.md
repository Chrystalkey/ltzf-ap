# Landtagszusammenfasser Administration Panel

This is the administration panel for the Landtagszusammenfasser API server. It provides a web interface for managing API keys, data, and manual data input.

The code is AI generated, I cannot program Elixir even in the slightest.

## Overview

The administration panel is built using Elixir and Phoenix, providing a secure and efficient interface for managing the Landtagszusammenfasser API server. The panel is divided into three main sections:

1. Key Management and Authorization
2. Data Management
3. Manual Data Input
## User Management Concept
The system employs an user account concept. 
Each user of the administration panel is uniquely identified by their email.
Each user of the administration panel is authorized by their password.

There is a superuser, which is the first user to register. They have the unique ability to activate/deactivate other accounts.

The first page of the web app is the registration page for the superuser.

## Key Management and Authorization Panel

### Features
- API Key Management
  - Create new API keys with different scopes (admin, collector, keyadder)
  - View existing API keys and their status
  - Rotate API keys with transition periods
  - Delete/revoke API keys
  - Set expiration dates for keys
- Authorization Control
  - View key usage statistics
  - Monitor rate limiting
  - Track key health and rotation status

The API Keys used to authorize the operations with the server are stored locally _only_.
They are to be put in by the user at each session entry.
They are deleted after the session expires.

- API Key CRUD operations interface
